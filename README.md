=======================

The intention of this application is to streamline meal recording, meal planning, and volunteer management at Haley House's Soup Kitchen. Records are currently kept on paper in a binder and haphazardly entered into an Excel sheet.  This application will hopefully help the meal leaders decide what to make and record the results effectively.  It should also help the volunteer coordinator know who has shown up to volunteer and with what frequency.
