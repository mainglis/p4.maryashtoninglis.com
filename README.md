=======================

The intention of this application is to streamline meal recording, meal planning, and volunteer management at Haley House's Soup Kitchen. Hopefully Shift Log will help shift heads decide what to make allow for effective recording of meals and volunteers.  Enjoy!

The application features include:
- Recording and viewing meals, sorted by last-date made
- Uploading photos of meals
- Searching for images of food ingredients
- Viewing and editing profile information

What I plan to add (to make this into its ideal version):
- A meal ranking system

Javascript is handling the search button and error reporting (to be added, hopefully, by the time I turn in this project).
